from envs.rover_domain.env_wrapper import RoverDomainPython

env = RoverDomainPython(args, NUM_EVALS)

args is a class with 


self.dim_x = WORLD_SIZE

self.obs_radius = OBSERVABILITY

self.act_dist = HOW FAR THE ROVER NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE A POI

self.angle_res = ANGLE_RESOLUTION

self.num_poi = NUM_POIS 

self.num_agents = NUM_AGENTS 

self.ep_len = EPISODE_LENGTH

self.poi_rand = INITIALIZE POI RANDOMLY? 

self.coupling = COUPLING 

self.rover_speed = SPEED OF ROVER (default is 1)

self.sensor_model = 'closest': report the closest distance 

self.action_dim = 2
                    'density': report the average (standard rover domain)




NUM_EVALS = Number of ROverDomain to run in parallel [Similar to a parallel universe - a policy will act in multiple universes (env) concurrently using the same feedforward operation] - massive speedup

Notes:
- shouldn't the env give out the action and obs dimensions?
