"""
SimulationCore class is the backbone of any arbitrary domain.
By default, SimulationCore does not provide any domain-specific functionality.
To provide functionality, modify the following attributes:

data:
A dictionary shared amongst all functions in the simulation.
User may add any property they may want to have shared by all provided functions
SimulationCore provides and manages the following keys during run() execution:
    "Number of Steps": duration of world measured in time steps,
    "Trains per Episode":  number of world instances for training to generate
        in sequence each episode
    "Tests per Episode":  number of world instances for testing to generate
        in sequence each episode
    "Number of Episodes": number of episodes (i.e. generations) in the trial
    "Episode Index": the index of the current episode in the trial
    "Mode": the current simulation mode which can be set to "Train" or "Test"
        Training mode runs before testing mode
    "World Index": the index of the current world instance in the current mode
        and episode
    "Step Index": the index of the current time step for the current world 
        instance
Warning: Use caution when manually reseting these values within the simulation.


Note: Each function (or callable class) must take in the dictionary data as its 
    first and only required parameter. 

trialBeginFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    beginning of the trial. These functions should set the entire simulation
    trial.

trainBeginFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    beginning of the training mode of the current episode. These functions 
    should set the episode for training. Train mode runs before test mode.
    
worldTrainBeginFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    beginning of the world instance of the current episode when in training 
    mode. These functions should set the world.

worldTrainStepFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    for each step in the current world instance when in training 
    mode.
    
self.worldTrainEndFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    at the end of the world instance of the current episode when
    in training mode. 

self.trainEndFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    at the end of the training mode of the current episode. 
    
testBeginFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    beginning of the testing mode of the current episode. These functions 
    should set the episode for testing. Train mode runs before test mode.
    
worldTrainBeginFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    beginning of the world instance of the current episode when in testing 
    mode. These functions should set the world.

worldTrainStepFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    for each step in the current world instance when in testing 
    mode.
    
self.worldTrainEndFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    at the end of the world instance of the current episode when
    in testing mode. 

self.testEndFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order  
    at the end of the testing mode of the current episode. 

trialEndFuncCol:
An ordered collection of functions; each function is executed in order at the 
    end of the trial. Some of these functions should save important trial
    information.

Note: Each function must take in the dictionary data as its first and only required 
    parameter.
